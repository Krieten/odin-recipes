    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These jalapeno popper twists are made from puff pastry sheets filled with bacon, cream cheese, Cheddar, and jalapenos, sliced into strips, twisted, and baked. This appetizer is a delicious 'twist' on your favorite poppers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed according to package directions</li>
        <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>8 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>2 jalapenos - seeded, quartered, and sliced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface, and roll out each pastry sheet until folds are smoothed out.</li>
        <li>Place one pastry puff sheet on the prepared baking sheet. Spread cream cheese in a thin layer over pastry; sprinkle with 2/3 shredded Cheddar, half the bacon and half the jalapenos.</li>
        <li>Place second sheet of pastry on top, aligning the edges. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the assembled pastry in half lengthwise, then cut into 1.5-inch strips crosswise.</li>
        <li>Brush pastry with beaten egg using a pastry brush. Twist each strip; touch up each twist with more egg wash as needed. Space twists out on the baking sheet; sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese, bacon, and jalapenos.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
